I am a Programme Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), New Delhi, India. I lead the work on air pollution data analytics and modelling. Previously, I worked as a data science mentor for the Indian Institute of Science and TalentSprint's Advanced Programme in Computational Data Science. I have a PhD in atmospheric sciences from the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, India.

My PhD research was on the following:

* Fog forecasting for the Kempegowda International Airport region using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.
* Developing algorithms for fog detection from satellite imagery
* Evaluating the effects of aerosols on the near-surface air temperature at night-time.
