# Crop residue burning

Farmers around the world burn crop residue after harvest for a variety of reasons. This practice causes air pollution and injects gases and aerosols into the atmosphere that exacerbate climate change. Therefore, tracking it accurately is essential to mitigate it.  


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
delayedArr = trainArr.to_delayed()

sampleSize = 2000

sampleArr = np.array([])
for i,_ in enumerate(delayedArr):
  np.random.seed(0)
  temp = delayedArr[i][0].reshape(-1).compute()

  if len(temp) > sampleSize*5:
    sample = np.random.choice(temp,size=2000,replace=False)
    sampleArr = np.append(sampleArr,sample)

  else:
    print(f'Chunk {i} is smaller than sampleSize of {sampleSize}')
    sample = np.random.choice(temp,size=int(len(temp)/4),replace=False)
    print(f'Sampling from a chunk of size {len(temp)}')
    sampleArr = np.append(sampleArr,sample)  
  {% endhighlight %}

You can insert some formula $$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$ in the middle of a sentence.
